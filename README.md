# Corona Fighter
A simple javascript point click/touch game idea for pratice purpose. Please do not take the theme seriously :)

## Techs Used:
- HTML
- CSS
  - Flexbox
  - Animations
  - Media Queries (Still needs better implementation)
  
- Javascript with: 

  - DOM Manipulation 
      
  - Timming control with setIntervals
      
  - Sound
      
  - Conditionals
      
  - And maybe some more? IDK.    
      
      
 The code can be a little messy so feel free to pull and give your insights about it.
 
 
 
 
 # TODO
 
 - Add some background sound
 
 - Add behavior to some elements like timing or lifebar requiring multiple clicks/touchs to get rid of it? 
 
 - Better Media Queries definitions to make it better workable on Tablets and Cellphones (idk how long this will be optimized but lets try)
 
 - Better codding. 
 
 - Better interface. Still too much "dark-ish"
